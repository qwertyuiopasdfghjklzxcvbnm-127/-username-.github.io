                    EBC is a week-long school trip where we get to step out of our normal classes and do more hands-on and exciting projects.
                    Instead of sitting in a classroom, we explore new ideas, develop different skills, and work closely with outside experts sometimes. 
                    Last year, my EBC week was a trip to <sup>Yellowstone National Park</sup> where we learned about the sustainability and science that goes into maintining the ecosystem of Yellowstone.
